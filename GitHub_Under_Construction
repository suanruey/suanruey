Hi everyone!

This is my first time making a public repository for myself on GitHub.

There are many things that I am still learning, and it will take me some time to set up future code bases for everyone's viewing.

In the meantime, stay tuned!

<!---
suanruey/suanruey is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
