# About myself

Hi, I’m Suan Ruey.
I’m interested in embedded programming, OpenCV exercises and anything that is fun!
I’m currently learning how to program Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi for network programmability and routing protocols.

I had also made a switch from the aerospace industry to the IT industry in cyber security.
So, I may update my GitHub page with interesting and my own intepretations of cybersecurity-related articles and codes in future.
Please do look forward it in my GitHub page!

#### Inactive progress at the moment:
(I’m looking to collaborate on any exciting IoT-based embedded projects, and I would like to pitch in any help if possible.)

How to reach me: Please reach me at suanruey@hotmail.com. Do introduce yourself, and let me know you are human!
